Graph-Matching

Graph::Matching is a Perl module for computing maximum weight matchings
in general graphs.

Maximum matching is a problem in mathematical graph theory.  This package
implements a routine which computes maximum weight matchings in a general
graphs in time O(number_of_nodes ** 3).

This package is not specifically related to the Graph package from CPAN
by Jarkko Hietaniemi.  Although of course it is possible to use the matching
algorithm with instances of the Graph class.
